# The JavaScript

Information about the default JavaScript included in the project.

## includeHTML.js

This file can be used to contain or reference your site/app JavaScript code.
For larger projects, you can make use of a JavaScript module loader, like
[Require.js](http://requirejs.org/), to load any other scripts you need to
run.

## vendor

This directory can be used to contain all 3rd party library code.

Minified versions of the latest jQuery and Modernizr libraries are included by
default. You may wish to create your own [custom Modernizr
build](http://www.modernizr.com/download/).
