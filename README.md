This project provides a front-end template for the header and footer
for USPTO web apps or sites.

* Source: [https://github.com/USPTO/USPTO-Global-Header-Footer]
          (https://github.com/USPTO/USPTO-Global-Header-Footer)

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:
1. Download the latest stable release from
   [USPTO-Global-Header-Footer](https://github.com/USPTO/USPTO-Global-Header-Footer) or create a
   custom build using [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com).
2. Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
   https://github.com/USPTO/USPTO-Global-Header-Footer` - and checkout the
   [tagged release](https://github.com/USPTO/USPTO-Global-Header-Footer/releases)
   you'd like to use.

You will also need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Node.js powers the front-end build and dependency management tools
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install grunt grunt-contrib-jshint grunt-contrib-less --save-dev
```

Install the project's dependencies with:
```
npm install
bower install
```
Tweak the path in
bower_components/USPTOPatternLibrary/usptostrap/less/usptostrap.less. Change
```
@bootstrap-path: "bootstrap/";
```
to
```
@bootstrap-path: "../../../bootstrap/";
```
Build the front-end assets (LESS/CSS/JS) with:
```
grunt build
```
